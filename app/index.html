      <h1>Software</h1>
      <h2>We are producers of bespoke software systems. Our sensitivity to detail is unparalled, and our reputation precedes us.</h2>
      <p><span>The belief that complex systems require armies</span> of designers and programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its entirety, or at least to a significant degree of detail by a single individual, should probably not be built. </p>
